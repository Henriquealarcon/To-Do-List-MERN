# To-Do-List-MERN
Project To Do List using MERN Stack - (Unfinished)

--This project have been delevoped with some extra lib, so be sure to follow this steps.

Step 1 - 
Clone this repository with the SSH or HTTPS key depending on wich you have configurated in your Github.

Step 2 - 
After cloning get into the archive and open a terminal. In the terminal press the comando *npm install* to build the extras packages needed to run the project.

Step 3 - 
In linux give this following commands on terminal *cd client* then *npm start* to run the front-end React based application. (Not finished and in need of fix.).
For the application of back end follow this: *cd server* then *npm start* (Working correctly but not with all the features).

************Libs used in this project.************
Back-End:

Express: A node module to make connections and routes http with NodeJs.(https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)
MongoDb: Non relational database i used in this project, its very familiar once starts to use.(https://docs.mongodb.com/)
Rescue:It helps assure that all errors are passing trough middelwares. High recomended.(https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-rescue)
Jsonwebtoken:Lib that can generate and authenticate tokens, perfect for login issues.(https://jwt.io/)

For tests:
Jest: This one of the most used libs for testing, and the one i most used to use.(https://jestjs.io/docs/next/getting-started)

Tools that helped me a lot while developing: 
--
Postman: place where i can simulate queries from the front end in the back end. 
(https://learning.postman.com/docs/publishing-your-api/documenting-your-api/)
--
Nodemon: with this tool you can keep your servers online even when making changes in the code, what helps a lot.

**************************************************

-- Features Working right in the moment (for now only backend)--

You can register and login with *validation of jwt* a new user to use the application.
You can create a new post only when logged in.

--Plans for the future of the project.

There are some features i`ll include in the days to come.

First i will create all the features of backend, including update and delete informations of the tasks, make sure the user will be able to see all the tasks are up to him in the moment he browse the page after logged in.

And then i will work on the front end, making the communication need to the MERN application work clean as it shoud be.

The visual of the website front, or the css will be made and updated mutually with the front end process.

************I will make sure all my project is covered in tests at the end of the process.************

*There are some extra futures there i have been thinking of that im going to test after im done with the main process. But thats spoilers :D
